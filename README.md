# GFX Suite

A set of online tools for providing authenticated access to the Connected Web Images API.

## Key features

- GFX Suite - hosted web interface with user authentication
- Images API - hosted web API for taking image requests
- Remote Crank - locally hosted image gen server
- Image hosting - images uploaded via FTP to be displayed in browser

Utilises [comfyanonymous/ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) as a local image gen service; using the Remote Crank to receive and process image requests.

The system is designed for cost-effective hosting - providing a public presence online (accessible from anywhere), while taking advantage of local hardware for relatively expensive image processing tasks.
